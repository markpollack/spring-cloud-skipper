= Getting started

This section describes the minimal steps to install Skipper in addition to installing a sample application.  It is the "three second tour".  After completing this section, you can move on to the "three minute tour" and when you are ready to dive deeper, head on over to the "three hour tour".

== System Requirements

The Skipper server and Shell are based on Java 8.  The server uses a RDBMS to store state.  An embedded H2 database is used if you do not provide a data source configuration.  In the 1.0 M1 release the schema is autogenerated from JPA annotations, so a wide range of databases should work.

== Install Skipper

This section will cover installing Skipper on your local machine as it is the easiest way to get started.  Installing Skipper on another platforms will be covered separately.

1. Download the Skipper Server and Shell apps:

```
wget http://repo.spring.io/milestones/org/springframework/cloud/spring-cloud-skipper-server/1.0.0.M1/spring-cloud-skipper-server-1.0.0.M1.jar

wget http://repo.spring.io/milestones/org/springframework/cloud/spring-cloud-skipper-shell/1.0.0.M1/spring-cloud-skipper-shell-1.0.0.M1.jar
```

2. Launch the Server and Shell apps:

```
java -jar spring-cloud-skipper-server-1.0.0.M1.jar


java -jar spring-cloud-skipper-shell-1.0.0.M1.jar
```

The default port that the server listens on is 7577.  That is `SKPR` on a telephone keypad.  :)

3. Install some apps!
